    "# Model Selection and Performance Testing<br>\n",
    "Results from the model_selection_v0 python notebook got me here, which is testing some optimized Logistic Regression models for use in predicting risk of 7 day mortality. In this notebook, I'll be finalizing the models and reporting on performance of the trained models on validation data, using 10-fold cross validation. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, other models will be ran (kNN, decision tree, maybe neural net) to show other future options, show a performance ceiling given the data inputs, despite the lack of model interpretability. I think a long-term modeling option is deep learning methods, or even XGboost, but right now, the models need to be fully interpretable. Thus, the focus on logistic regression.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While the previous notebook identified median columnar imputation of missing data as the superior method (when compared to adding 0 for missing data), I'm still going to test each model version against both methods of imputation, as I think it would be worthwhile to quantify the improvements in model performance with median imputation. Additionally, seeing errors for each imputation method will be informative. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One data processing step I would like to also test is z-scaling (normalizing data to mean = 0, sd = 1) for all data. By doing this, I think I will get a better representation of which variables appear to be most informative of the outcome, which again will help with interpretability clinically. While yes, the scales themselves will need to be re-converted for direct interpretation, I don't think this will be necessary, as most people right now just want to know WHAT is informative, not necessarily how much."
